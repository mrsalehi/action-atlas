EXAMPLE:
SPORT: Soccer
ACTION: Double stepover
HARD_NEGATIVES: Cruyff Turn, Elastico, Roulette, Rainbow Flick, Nutmeg, Drag Back, Rabona, Maradona Turn, Heel Flick
RESPONSE:
Cruyff Turn:
The Double Stepover involves a player rapidly spinning their foot around the ball twice without touching it to mislead an opponent. In contrast, the Cruyff Turn is performed by feinting a pass or shot before pulling the ball behind the standing leg with the inside of the foot, often to turn away from the defender.

Elastico:
The Double Stepover is a trick primarily used to confuse defenders with quick, circular foot movements around the ball. The Elastico, however, involves pushing the ball in one direction with the outside of the foot and then quickly snapping it back in the opposite direction with the inside of the same foot.

Roulette:
The Double Stepover is performed in front of the ball to feint direction changes. The Roulette, or Zidane turn, involves a player using one foot to drag the ball back and the other to spin 360 degrees around it, effectively shielding the ball with their body.

Rainbow Flick:
The Double Stepover does not involve contact with the ball until the move is completed. In contrast, the Rainbow Flick entails flicking the ball up from behind with one foot and then using the other foot to lift it over both the player and the opponent, usually when the opponent is approaching from behind.

Nutmeg:
The Double Stepover is used to create space and mislead defenders through body feints around the ball. A Nutmeg, however, specifically aims to pass the ball between an opponentâ€™s legs, exploiting their open stance.

Drag Back:
While the Double Stepover involves moving around the ball to deceive, the Drag Back is a simpler maneuver where the ball is pulled back with the sole of the foot to change direction quickly or retain possession under pressure.

Rabona:
The Double Stepover is a feint performed with natural foot movements around the ball. The Rabona is a flamboyant technique where a player wraps one leg behind the standing leg to strike the ball, often used for crossing or shooting from an awkward position.

Maradona Turn:
The Double Stepover involves deceptive footwork without body rotation around the ball. The Maradona Turn, similar to the Roulette, combines a drag back with a 360-degree turn, using the body extensively to shield the ball.

Heel Flick:
The Double Stepover is about misleading defenders with foot feints around the ball. The Heel Flick, however, involves flicking the ball backward with the heel, often to pass to a teammate or to clear space when running forward.

Explanation for Amazon Mechanical Turk Annotators:
Task Description:
Your task is to watch a soccer (football) video and identify moments when a player performs a move known as a "step over." It is important to watch the players' feet and the ball closely to accurately spot these actions.

What is a "Step Over"?
A "step over" is a dribbling move used by soccer players to trick an opponent into thinking they are going to move the ball in a certain direction, but instead, they move it in the opposite direction or retain its current path. This move is often used to outmaneuver a defender and create space for advancing towards the goal or making a pass.

Key Elements to Look For:
Player with the Ball: Focus on players who are in possession of the ball and are facing an opponent directly, usually a defender.

Foot Movement: The player will quickly move one foot around the front of the ball (without touching it) in a circular motion. It looks as if they are going to kick or push the ball in the direction their foot is moving, but they don't.

Body Feint: Along with the foot movement, the player might also use their body to fake a move in a certain direction. They may lean or look one way to further deceive the defender.

Continuation of Play: After performing the step over, the player either continues to dribble the ball in the original direction or changes direction swiftly, bypassing the opponent. This is the critical moment of the step over, where the trickery culminates in the player's next move.

Frequency: This move can happen multiple times and by different players throughout the game. It is a common dribbling technique.

Examples and Practice:
Practice Spotting: It might be helpful to watch a few examples of "step overs" in soccer training videos or match highlights to get a sense of the move before starting the task.
Video Speed: Consider slowing down the video playback speed if you're having trouble spotting the move. This can make it easier to see the quick footwork involved in a step over.
Your Task:
As you watch the video, note the timestamp(s) when you believe a "step over" occurs. If possible, describe the action and the player using visual cues, such as the number on their back, their name if visible (e.g., "blue team player near the corner flag at 02:15") to provide context for your observations.

Remember, this task requires attention to detail, as the move can be quick and subtle. Your accurate identification of these moments is valuable for our analysis.

GPT4_ANNOTATOR_DESCRIPTION_V2 = """I want to give a video to an annotator on Amazon mechanical turk and they should find when the action "{action}" in sport "{sport}" happens in the video.
Assume that they don't know about {sport} at all. Explain what {action} is in simple terms and what they should look for in the video. Be comprehensive but explain everything in simple terms.
Here is an example for "jab step" in Basketball to help you learn the output template. Just use this as a template so don't use any basketball related info from this example in your response.
---
In basketball, a jab step is a quick, deceptive movement used by the player with the ball to test the defenderâ€™s reaction or to create space for a shot or drive. It involves the player with the ball making a short, sharp step with one foot while keeping the other foot planted as a pivot foot. The movement looks like a quick poke or "jab" toward the floor, which is where the name comes from.
Simple Steps to Identify a Jab Step:

1. Identify the Player with the Ball: First, focus on the player who is holding the basketball. This is important because only the player with the ball can perform a jab step.

2. Look at Their Feet: Observe the playerâ€™s feet closely. One foot will remain in contact with the floor at all times; this is the pivot foot. The other foot will quickly step forward, to the side, or even backward.

3. Watch the Quick Step: The key to spotting a jab step is to see a quick, short step by the non-pivot foot. This step is not meant to move the player significantly in any direction; instead, itâ€™s meant to make the defender think they are going to move.

4. Check the Defenderâ€™s Reaction: Often, the purpose of a jab step is to see how the defender reacts. If the defender moves or flinches backward or to one side, the jab step has done its job.

5. Look for Subsequent Actions: After the jab step, watch what the player does next. They might shoot, pass, or drive towards the basket depending on the defenderâ€™s reaction.

Note the Timing: Whenever you observe these elementsâ€”the player with the ball, the quick step with one foot, and the defender's reactionâ€”note the time in the video. This is likely when a jab step is happening.
